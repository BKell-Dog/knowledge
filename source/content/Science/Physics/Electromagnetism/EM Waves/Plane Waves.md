# Description
The equation for a uniform plane wave can be derived from [[The Maxwell Equations|the Maxwell Equations]] by assuming a wave that varies only along one dimension, which we define as the x-dimension, through a medium that is [[Medium#Homogeneity|homogeneous]], [[Medium#Isotropism|isotropic]], [[Medium#Linearity|linear]], and with [[Medium#Conductivity|zero conductivity]].
