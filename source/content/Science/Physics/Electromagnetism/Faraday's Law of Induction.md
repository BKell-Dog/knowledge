[[Michael Faraday]] discovered his law of induction experimentally. When he moved a magnet near a coil of wire connected to a galvanometer (a current meter), the needle deflected, indicating a current. But the current only flowed while the magnet was moving, not when it was stationary. If he stopped the motion, the current stopped. Reversing the direction reversed the current.
