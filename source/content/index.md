title: Kelly's Lab Knowledge Base
---
Welcome to my knowledge base. I will be continuously developing this to document the most important knowledge that contributes to my skills. This will capture formal knowledge (calculus, engineering, etc.), as well as life skills and aesthetic preferences (design, art, etc.). All pages are works in progress.

This page is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notebook turned into HTML, so things are linked in a graph network. Get started with,
- Math $\to$ [[Vector Fields]]
- Physics $\to$ [[The Maxwell Equations]]
- Web Ecosystem $\to$ [[Sites I Like]]
- Biographies $\to$ [[Michael Faraday]]
