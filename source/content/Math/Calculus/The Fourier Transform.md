# Before the Fourier Transform

There are problems which could not

# Joseph Fourier

The basic proposition of Fourier's idea was that any function could be formulated as an infinite sum of an infinite series of cosines, each of which has a different coefficient determining its magnitude, some being more influential, some being less. Then instead of describing a function by its own formula, we could describe it in terms of an infinite (or finite!) series of coefficients.

$$ \begin{align}
F(u) &= \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} f(x)\,\cos(ux)\, dx \\ \\

f(x) &= \int_{0}^{\infty} F(u) \, \cos(ux) \, dx
\end{align}
$$
