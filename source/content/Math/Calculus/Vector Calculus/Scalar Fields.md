# Definition
A scalar field is a function in $n$-dimensional space, $\mathbb{R}^n$, which maps a scalar value onto every point in that space. Unlike a [[Vector Fields|vector field]], a scalar field assigns no direction to each point.

A trivially simple scalar field in 2D space might be $f(x, y) = c$, where $c$ is some constant real number, thus giving a scalar field that is uniform everywhere. A slightly more complex one might be $f(x, y) = x$, giving a field that changes linearly along the x-axis.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field) gives a good visualization of a scalar field in 2D space:
