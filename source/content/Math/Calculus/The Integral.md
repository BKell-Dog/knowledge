# Definition

For a function $f(x)$ which is defined on the interval $[a,b]$, then the integral of that function is
$$
\\lim_{ n \to \infty } \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(x_{i}) \, \Delta x = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
$$

## Derivation

The integral originally solved the problem of finding the areas of certain geometric shapes or curves; introductory explanations of the integral still approach by this route.
