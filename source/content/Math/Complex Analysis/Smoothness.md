# Definition
A function is smooth if it is infinitely differentiable on its entire domain. A function is smooth on some interval $(a, b)$ if it is infinitely differentiable on that interval with derivatives that remain [[Continuity|continuous]].

Differentiability is denoted as $C^k$. A function whose derivatives up to order four exist and are continuous on an interval $(a,b)$ is said to be $C^4$ (pronounced "C four") on that interval; a function which can be differentiated infinitely many times and whose derivatives remain continuous for every order is said to be $C^{\infty}$ ("C infinity") on (a, b)$. The cosine function, for example, is $C^{\infty}$, because when it is differentiated it transforms into the sine function, and the sine function transforms into the cosine.
$$
f(x) = \cos(x) \\[1.5em]
f'(x) = -\sin(x) \\[1.5em]
f''(x) = -\cos(x) \\[1.5em]
f''(x) = \sin(x) \\[1.5em]
f'''(x) = \cos(x) \\[1.5em]
\dots \\[1.5em]
\therefore f(x) \in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})
$$
A smooth function must be $C^{\infty}$.
