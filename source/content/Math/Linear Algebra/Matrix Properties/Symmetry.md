# Definition
A matrix $M$ is symmetric if it equals its own transpose:
$$
M=M^T
$$
For a 2x2 matrix, this means that the two off-diagonal elements must be equal:
$$
M = \begin{pmatrix}
a \quad b \\
b \quad c
\end{pmatrix}
$$

# Antisymmetry
## Definition
A matrix $M$ is antisymmetric if it equals the negative of its own transpose:
$$
M = -M^T
$$
For a 2x2 matrix, this means that all diagonal elements must be equal to $0$, since $a=-a$ implies $a=0$, and that the off-diagonals are negatives of each other:
$$
M = \begin{pmatrix}
0 \quad b \\
-b \quad 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$0 \quad b \\
-b \quad 0
